## Le rustic, experimental, base template for pygames python game engine

An attempt at making pygame more robust and more game engine like, with features such as scenes and game objects

### Future Milestones (?)
[ ] Maybe a GUI for easy scene and game object creation ?
[ ] Make game objects more flexible
[ ] Improve object inheritence and polymorphism ?
[ ] Make a custom dictionary for different custom events so accesing them is easier ?
